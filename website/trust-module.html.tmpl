<h1>Project: Trust Storage Module</h1>

<p>This is a PKCS#11 module that exposes read-only storage of system
certificates and trust policy. It loads the certificates and trust
storage from a directory of files.</p>

<p>Crypto libraries are able to use this as a shared source of certificate
authority anchors, black lists, and other locally stored system trust policy.</p>

<p>There is work going on to define a comprehensive representation of
this <a href="sharing-trust-policy.html">shared trust policy</a>. Once such a
solution matures we hope to implement it in this PKCS#11 trust storage module.</p>

<p>Also included will be a tool that can be used to extract certificates in
various formats for crypto libraries not (or not yet) able to read from this
PKCS#11 trust module directly.</p>

<p>A goal is to have minimal dependencies, and be crypto library agnostic so this
can be used by any library or app. Accesses information owned by root and configured
by a system administrator or distro creator. These PKCS#11 objects are read-only
and so don't need to go through a coordinating daemon. Thus we can implement an
efficient, reliable lookup for these system certs and other objects, with less
moving parts.</p>

<h2>Source Repository</h2>

<p>So far <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/p11-glue/p11-kit/log/?h=trust">the code</a>
lives in the <tt>trust</tt> branch of the <tt>p11-kit</tt> repository:</p>

<pre>
$ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/p11-glue/p11-kit
$ cd p11-kit
$ git checkout trust
</pre>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>An initial implementation of the module is available, and you can try it out. A dependency
on libtasn1-devel is required to build the PKCS#11 trust module.</p>

<pre>
$ sh autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --libdir=/usr/lib64 --enable-debug \
	--with-system-anchors=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.trust.crt:/etc/pki/tls/certs/anchors
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo mv -v /usr/lib64/libnssckbi.so /opt/libnssckbi.so.orig-nss
$ sudo ln -sv pkcs11/p11-kit-trust.so /usr/lib64/libnssckbi.so
</pre>

<p>Now place some certificates in the <tt>--with-system-anchors</tt> location(s).
Right now, as input, you can use DER, PEM or OpenSSL style 'trusted
certificates'.</p>

<p>For example you can tweak some trust policy bits like so:</p>

<pre>
$ openssl x509 -addtrust serverAuth -addreject clientAuth \
	-in /path/to/my-ca.pem -out /etc/pki/tls/certs/anchors/my-ca.pem
</pre>

<p>Now you can run apps like Firefox and see the certificates appear in the
Certificate manager and are trusted as appropriate. You can use a command like
this to see some debug output:</p>

<pre>
$ P11_KIT_DEBUG=all firefox
</pre>

<p>The extraction tool is not yet ready.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Still in proposal/conceptual stages.</p>
