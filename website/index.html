<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is an effort to use and promote PKCS#11 as glue between crypto
libraries and security applications on the open source desktop.</p>

<p><img src="images/p11-glue.jpg"></p>

<p>On the desktop today we have a variety of technically excelent crypto
libraries (such as NSS, GnuTLS, OpenSSL etc.) The diversity allows each to
excel and progress in its area of focus. Applications choose to use different
crypto libraries for all sorts of good reasons.</p>

<p>Users suffer because the desktop lacks a consistent way to use certificates
or keys with all the various applications. For example different applications
look for their trust anchor certificates in different places, and configuring
each application with a client certificate is a laborious task.</p>

<p>Developers suffer because when an application needs to use security
(like TLS), the application needs to provide support for all sorts of
security configuration, cetrificate/key file locations, security exceptions,
and so on. And so progress suffers because there's no foundation for consistent
place to store security stuff on the desktop.</p>

<p>PKCS#11 is a standard for accessing crypto objects like keys and certificates
and performing cryptographic operations on them. It's often used together with
smart cards.</p>

<p>By using PKCS#11 to provide a plugable way for crypto libraries and other
software to access keys, certificate, and things like trust anchors, we can
solve the above problems.</p>

<h2>Project: p11-kit</h2>

<p>Provides a way to load and enumerate PKCS#11 modules. Provides a standard
configuration setup for installing PKCS#11 modules in such a way that they're
discoverable.</p>

<p>Also solves problems with coordinating the use of PKCS#11 by different
components or libraries living in the same process.</p>

<h2>Spec: Trust Assertions</h2>

<p>A trust assertion represents a single piece of information about the user's
or system's trust preferences. These can be used to make consistent trust
decisions.<p>

<p>There's a specification for how trust assertions work, and how they can
be stored within PKCS#11.</p>

<h2>Spec: PKCS#11 URIs</h2>

<p>PKCS#11 URIs are a way to identify a certain crypto object that resides
in a PkCS#11 module. These URIs can be used in configuration files, or when
one application needs to refer another to a cryptographic object, like a key
or a certificate.</p>
