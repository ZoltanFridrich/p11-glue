	<title>Representation: DBus API</title>

	<para>On the Linux desktop various apps would like to do lookups or modifications
		of anchor data via DBus. This also facilitates concepts such as
		privilege escalation (polkit prompting) to modify the system
		wide trust stores.</para>

	<note>
		<title>Work item</title>
		<para>We need to look at the interested DBus
		callers and discuss the desired form.  It is undesirable to design an
		API in a vacuum. Therefore if you are such an interested caller,
		please contact
		<ulink url="http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/p11-glue">p11-glue@lists.freedesktop.org</ulink>
		for discussion.</para>
