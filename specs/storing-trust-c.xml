	<title>Representation: C API</title>

	<para>Although the <link linkend="storing-trust-pkcs11">PKCS#11 representation</link>
		is callable from C, there is likely a need for a simpler C API and ABI to
		access the trust information.</para>

	<note>
		<title>Work item</title>
		<para>At the present time no C caller for
		such an API exists. Most crypto libraries already use PKCS#11 to access
		keys and certificates, and thus they are not the consumer for this C API.
		It is also undesirable to design an API in a vacuum. Therefore if you are
		such an interested caller, please contact
		<ulink url="http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/p11-glue">p11-glue@lists.freedesktop.org</ulink>
		for discussion.</para>
