	<title>Representation: JSON</title>

	<para>Since various browsers already represent trust information as JSON data
		there is likely a need to have a standard JSON form for the the models
		described in these documents.</para>

	<note>
		<title>Work Item</title>
		<para>We need to look at the interested JSON
		callers and discuss the desired form.  It is undesirable to design an
		API in a vacuum. Therefore if you are such an interested caller,
		please contact
		<ulink url="http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/p11-glue">p11-glue@lists.freedesktop.org</ulink>
		for discussion.</para>
